1. Configurate db in config/db_config.php

2. Import movies.sql to your database

3. You could run app with 
"php -S localhost:8000"
or "php -S localhost:8000 -c php.ini"
in case you have problems with connecting db
write path to your mysql.sock file in php.ini and write
"php -S localhost:8000 -c php.ini"
